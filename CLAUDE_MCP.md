# CLAUDE_MCP.md

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridges that let Claude drive the
running yquake2 client and the running Roblox Studio instance. Both are
registered in [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) so they load as project-scoped MCP
servers.

| Server          | What it drives              | Status                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `yquake2`       | yquake2 client              | Working end-to-end, gl1 renderer only  |
| `roblox_studio` | Roblox Studio (any running) | Official Roblox MCP, ships with Studio |

## Track 1 — yquake2

Working end-to-end on Windows + gl1 renderer.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code ──stdio MCP──▶ q2_bridge.server (Python) ──TCP──▶ yquake2 (mcp_server.c)
```

Two tiers:

1. **Inside yquake2** ([src/common/mcp_server.c](src/common/mcp_server.c)):
   line-delimited JSON-RPC over TCP on `127.0.0.1:<port>`. Single client
   at a time. Polled once per `Qcommon_Frame` — single-threaded,
   synchronous dispatch.
2. **Outside yquake2** ([mcp/q2_bridge/](mcp/q2_bridge/)): Python stdio
   MCP server using the official `mcp` SDK. Stateless — every tool call
   opens a fresh TCP connection.

The Python tier exists because implementing the full MCP protocol
(stdio framing, schemas, image content types) in C would be ~10x the
code; the JSON-RPC over TCP boundary lets the heavy lifting stay in
Python where the SDK is one `pip install` away.

## Cvars

| Cvar              | Default       | Notes                                |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `mcp_server_port` | `0`           | Set non-zero to enable. Loopback only by default. |
| `mcp_server_bind` | `127.0.0.1`   | Change to `0.0.0.0` for non-loopback (no auth — trusted networks only). |

Both are `CVAR_NOSET` (must be set on the launch command line):

```
yquake2 +set mcp_server_port 28910
```

## JSON-RPC protocol

Each request is one line:
```json
{"method":"q2_console","params":{"cmd":"echo hello"}}
```

Each response is one line:
```json
{"result":{"output":"hello\n","commands_executed":1}}
```
or
```json
{"error":"description"}
```

### Methods

- **`q2_console`** — `params: {cmd: string}` → `{result: {output: string,
  commands_executed: int}}`. Wraps `Cbuf_AddText(cmd); Cbuf_Execute()` in
  `MCP_CaptureBegin/End`, returning every `Com_Printf` produced during
  execution.
- **`q2_screenshot`** — `params: {}` → `{result: {png_base64: string,
  width: int, height: int, format: "png"}}`. Calls the registered
  screenshot provider (set up by client code), PNG-encodes via
  `stbi_write_png_to_func` to a memory buffer, base64-encodes.
- **`q2_get_state`** — *stubbed* (returns "not implemented"). Easy
  follow-up: run `where` internally, parse, return structured fields.

## Files involved

**Common (engine, both client and dedicated):**
- [src/common/header/mcp_server.h](src/common/header/mcp_server.h) — public API
- [src/common/header/mcp_json.h](src/common/header/mcp_json.h) — JSON helpers API
- [src/common/mcp_server.c](src/common/mcp_server.c) — TCP listener, dispatch, capture, base64
- [src/common/mcp_json.c](src/common/mcp_json.c) — minimal JSON parser/writer

**Wired into engine main loop:**
- [src/common/frame.c](src/common/frame.c) — `MCP_Init` after `NET_Init`,
  `MCP_RunFrame` after `Cbuf_Execute` in both client and dedicated
  `Qcommon_Frame`, `MCP_Shutdown` first in `Qcommon_Shutdown`.
- [src/common/clientserver.c](src/common/clientserver.c) — one-line hook
  in `Com_VPrintf` calling `MCP_CaptureAppend(msg)`.

**Client-only (screenshot path):**
- [src/client/vid/header/ref.h](src/client/vid/header/ref.h) — added
  `RetrieveScreenshot` to `refexport_t` (ABI change — all renderer DLLs
  must be rebuilt together).
- [src/client/refresh/gl1/gl1_misc.c](src/client/refresh/gl1/gl1_misc.c)
  — `R_RetrieveScreenshot` reads framebuffer via `glReadPixels`.
- [src/client/refresh/gl1/gl1_main.c](src/client/refresh/gl1/gl1_main.c)
  — `re.RetrieveScreenshot = R_RetrieveScreenshot` in `GetRefAPI`.
- [src/client/mcp_client.c](src/client/mcp_client.c) — PNG-encodes via
  `stb_image_write` (header-only, already implementation-defined in
  vid.c), registers as MCP screenshot provider.
- [src/client/cl_main.c](src/client/cl_main.c) — `MCP_ClientInit()` call
  added to `CL_Init`.

**Build:**
- [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) — `mcp_server.c` and `mcp_json.c`
  added to both `Common-Source` and `Server-Source`. `mcp_client.c`
  added to client-only sources. Headers added to client and server
  header lists. `ws2_32` was already linked by the existing UDP
  netcode.

**Bridge (Python):**
- [mcp/q2_bridge/pyproject.toml](mcp/q2_bridge/pyproject.toml)
- [mcp/q2_bridge/q2_bridge/server.py](mcp/q2_bridge/q2_bridge/server.py)
- [mcp/q2_bridge/q2_bridge/__init__.py](mcp/q2_bridge/q2_bridge/__init__.py)
- [mcp/q2_bridge/README.md](mcp/q2_bridge/README.md) — install + Claude
  Code config

## Setting it up on a fresh machine

1. Build yquake2 (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#building-windows-msvc)).
2. `pip install -e mcp/q2_bridge/` (Python 3.10+).
3. Add to `~/.claude/mcp.json` or project `.mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "yquake2": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["-m", "q2_bridge.server"],
         "env": { "Q2_MCP_PORT": "28910" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Launch yquake2 with `+set mcp_server_port 28910`.

## Driving a map as a noclip spectator

To teleport / setangles around a map for reference shots, commands must
run in this order:

1. `set cheats 1` — enable cheats on the server. Must be set **before**
   `map`: `cheats` is a `CVAR_SERVERINFO | CVAR_LATCH` cvar, so toggling
   it mid-game has no effect until the next map load. The game DLL reads
   it during `ClientConnect` to decide whether cheat commands are
   registered.
2. `map battle` — load the map. This spawns the player and connects the
   local client, at which point cheat-gated commands (`noclip`, `give`,
   `god`, the custom `where` / `teleport_exact` / `setangles` /
   `setforward`) become callable.
3. `noclip` — fly freely through geometry. Without this, `teleport_exact`
   still works but the player falls / collides on the next frame.

Single round-trip shorthand that works over the bridge:

```
q2_console("set cheats 1 ; map battle")
q2_console("noclip")
q2_console("cmd teleport_exact -848 -1328 480")
q2_console("cmd setangles 0 135 0")
```

Gotchas observed in practice:

- The `cmd` prefix is required for the custom game-side commands
  (`where`, `teleport_exact`, `setangles`, `setforward`). They're
  registered in [src/game/g_cmds.c](src/game/g_cmds.c) as client
  commands, not engine commands.
- `cmd` forwarding takes a round-trip through the client→server→client
  netchan before `gi.cprintf` output reaches Com_Printf on the client.
  `q2_console` keeps the capture window open for ~100ms (time-based,
  because `MCP_RunFrame` ticks at render framerate but `SV_Frame` only
  runs at packet framerate) so the forwarded output lands in the JSON
  response as plain text. No screenshot / screen-scraping needed.
- `cmd setangles` pitch tends to get reset to 0 on the next frame under
  noclip because the movement code re-derives `v_angle` from input.
  Yaw holds fine; for precise pitch, use `setforward` instead.

**Stay inside the playable volume.** Noclip exists to fly around the
map freely — not to escape it. Teleporting outside the world or into a
solid wall is an easy mistake when guessing coordinates:

- A bright solid-orange screen (sky, gun, HUD all tinted) is the
  "leak" color yquake2 draws when the eye is outside any BSP leaf. If
  you see orange with no visible geometry, you're outside the map —
  re-teleport inward.
- A bright-red/orange *wash* that still shows geometry through it means
  the eye is *inside* a lava/water contents brush (or standing in
  lava). Still inside the map, but the view is tinted and the player is
  taking damage — fine for exploration, but clip out to get clean
  reference shots.
- Map bounds come from `dmodel_t[0]`'s mins/maxs in the BSP (see the
  recon Python in session history). For `battle.bsp`: x ∈ [-1862,
  1032], y ∈ [-1608, 392], z ∈ [-72, 776]. But those are the bounding
  box of all worldspawn brushes — not every point inside the box is
  inside a room. Prefer positions near known-good spawn points
  (`info_player_deathmatch` entries in the `entityString`).
- When you're unsure, `cmd where` after teleporting and inspect the
  screenshot: if the view is flat orange or clearly inside a wall,
  teleport back to a known good spot before continuing.

## Smoke test (no Claude Code, just Python + TCP)

```python
import socket, json, base64
s = socket.create_connection(('127.0.0.1', 28910), timeout=10)
s.sendall((json.dumps({"method":"q2_console","params":{"cmd":"echo hi"}})+"\n").encode())
s.shutdown(socket.SHUT_WR)
data = b""
while chunk := s.recv(65536):
    data += chunk
print(json.loads(data.decode().splitlines()[0]))
```

## Known limitations / follow-ups

- **gl1 only** for screenshots. Other renderers (gl3, gl4/gles3, soft, vk)
  default `RetrieveScreenshot` to NULL — `q2_screenshot` returns "screenshot
  not available". Adding each is mechanical: copy the `glReadPixels`
  pattern (or per-backend equivalent), respect that GL3 may use RGBA on
  GLES, and software returns palette indices that need conversion.
- **No auth.** Don't bind to non-loopback unless on a trusted network.
- **Single client.** New connection displaces previous. Fine for Claude;
  a second tool would have to wait its turn.
- **Synchronous dispatch.** A long-running console command (e.g.
  `map demo1`) will block the engine for as long as the load takes,
  which also blocks rendering. Acceptable since nothing competes during
  testing.
- **`q2_get_state` is stubbed.** Add by capturing `where` output and
  parsing the printed fields.

## Track 2 — Roblox Studio

Roblox ships the official MCP server bundled with Studio:

- Binary: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\Versions\version-*\StudioMCP.exe`
- Version-independent launcher: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\mcp.bat`
- Companion Studio plugin: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\Plugins\MCPStudioPlugin.rbxm`
  (must be enabled inside Studio for tools to respond)

`.mcp.json` invokes the launcher over stdio:
```json
"roblox_studio": {
    "command": "cmd",
    "args": ["/c", "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Roblox\\mcp.bat", "--stdio"]
}
```

### Available tools (verified via [mcp/probe_roblox.py](mcp/probe_roblox.py))

The server advertises `protocolVersion: 2024-11-05` and the following
tools (names as reported by `tools/list`):

- **Scene inspection**: `search_game_tree`, `inspect_instance`
- **Script work**: `script_search`, `script_read`, `script_grep`,
  `multi_edit`
- **Execution**: `execute_luau`, `start_stop_play`, `subagent`
- **Creation**: `generate_mesh`, `generate_material`,
  `insert_from_creator_store`
- **Camera / input**: `character_navigation`, `user_mouse_input`,
  `user_keyboard_input`
- **Capture**: `screen_capture`, `get_console_output`
- **Multi-Studio**: `list_roblox_studios`, `set_active_studio`

`screen_capture` + `execute_luau` are the two that matter for the
bsp2rbx feedback loop: load a converted `.rbxlx`, screenshot the Studio
viewport, compare against a `q2_screenshot` of the same vantage in
yquake2, iterate.

### Probe / sanity check

Run [mcp/probe_roblox.py](mcp/probe_roblox.py) with Studio open and the
MCPStudioPlugin enabled. It sends `initialize` + `tools/list` and prints
the server's responses. Handy for verifying the pipe is live without
round-tripping through Claude Code.

### Known limitations

- Requires Studio running *and* the MCPStudioPlugin enabled in it. With
  Studio closed or the plugin disabled, `tools/list` still succeeds but
  tool calls error out.
- `mcp.bat` resolves the latest installed Studio version at each invoke;
  fine in practice but means each Claude Code session binds to whatever
  Studio was most recently installed.
